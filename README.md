## Project Overview 

### How is the gameâ€™s structure organized?

### Which functions do you have and how are they imported?

### Which features did you add to the game?

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook 
- VSC Code 

## Technical Challenges (erros & mistakes)
 
#### What was the most important technical challenge you faced?
The most important technical challenge was to collaborate remotely and in real time and quickly get to grips with tools that you didn't even know existed 3 weeks ago.

### How did you overcome that challenge?
Team spirit, determination and good communication helped us overcome this challenge as a team. Researching the errors on Google and utilising the information during our classes. We also utilised AI to explain the errors.

### What was the biggest mistake you made during this project?
Failing to complete all the key variables mostly by omission. Lack of understanding in the nature of certain functions which turned into infinite loops. 

### What did you learn from it?
Attention to detail is vital in order to prevent mistakes and also augmenting the level of understanding of certain functions is key in order to correct mistake in a timely manner.
